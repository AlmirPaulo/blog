  As I said the last time I worked with webtoons, it was a nice experience, and it was again. But I confess the last time <a href="https://almirpaulo.github.io/blog/contributing--to-webtoons.html">with Dr. Frost</a> I may have made some mistakes. I realize that by look at other Portuguese translations that was better than mine in some aspects like visuals (in the font styles, that I notice that it's not really preserved as the originals, but reworked) and in the word choices at some points.</p>

<p>
  But now I've found another really interesting webtoon called "War and Peas". It's actually a kind of a comic strip. A very funny one. Here is the synopsis:
<blockquote>
A robot hopelessly in love, a promiscuous yet self-assured witch, and a fatally laid-back grim reaper. This never-ending webcomic of woefully funny stories will leave you cry-laughing or the other way around.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
I think I will continue to translate War and Peas from time to time. Translating comedy is a special challenge, it's not just changing the words (it's never that simple), you have to keep the meaning to keep the joke. An excellent practice for every translator.
