Contributing to the translation of <a href="https://www.webtoons.com/en/mystery/dr-frost/list?title_no=371">Dr, Frost</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/jongbeom">JongBeom Lee
</a>


<p>
  I had a very nice experience these days translating a famous webtoon: Dr. Frost. The webtoons plataform has support for fans translations. There is a huge community translating all sort of webtoons you can imagine. I thought would be nice to try it once. And Dr. Frost is webtoons that is helping me a lot to pratice my french. I mean, of course the original toungue is probably Korean, but there is a French translation too. 
</p>
<p>
  If you don't know what is a webtoon, it's the same of webcomics, actually webtoon is the name of a famous website where you can find a lot of them, but the name kind a stick to the webcomics. And if you don't know Dr Frost here is a sinopsis directly from Webtoons:
  <blockquote>College professor by day, and bartender by night, psychologist Dr. Frost believes in one simple belief. Humans are all the same. He uses this tenet to guide his practice, and solves the puzzles of the human mind one by one.</blockquote>

  I've said I am reading Dr. Frost in French, but this time, I translate with the pair English-Portuguese. The episode in particular was one where Pavlov (Dr. Frost's dog) goes to play with other dogs, and then it comes out Pavlov knows a bit of Psychology too. haha.
</p>

<p>
  Some special details from translate a comic are an attention to the available space in the balloons and the font styles.  
</p>

<p>
  Well, it was a very nice experience after all. I would like to do it again, but would be better if paid. haha.
