  This weekend I worked in very exciting project: Portuguese subtitles for a Batman film. Ok... Not really an official Batman film, it was a fan made film. But the story is great!
</p>

<p>
  It's called "Bats & Jokes", by Farbod Ardebili. As you can imagine by the title, there is the Joker in the story! Here is the synopsis:
  <blockquote>
Joker has broken out of Arkham Asylum and all the villains are now under his command. Two-Face, Penguin, Riddler, Deadshot, Killer Croc, they all take orders from Joker now! As usual, Batman is on his way to save Gotham once more, but nobody can expect what is about to come next. No one except for Darkseid maybe!
This is the story of Gotham's longest night filled with tales of death, immortality, apocalypse, destiny, and time travel! 
But most importantly this is the night that Joker's true origin and real name will be revealed to the world.
  </blockquote>

  I could practice my subtitling skills and I found an interesting software for subtitles. Actually I didn't need it in the end, but I will certainly use it in future occasions.
